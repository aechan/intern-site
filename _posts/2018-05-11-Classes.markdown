# Classes

Classes in C++ are very similar to classes in Java, but they have a slightly different syntax.

Here is an example of a simple class declaration and definition.

- `Person.h`

```cpp
#include <string>

class Person {
public:
    setName(std::string name);
    setAge(int age);
private:
    std::string name;
    int age;
};
```

- `Person.cpp`

```cpp
#include <string>
#include "Person.h"

using namespace std;

Person::setName(string name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person::setAge(int age) {
    this.age = age;
}
```

So, to break this down, we declared our `Person` class in the header file `Person.h` and within our `Person` class we have some public methods as well as private fields. In C++ access modifiers like `private` and `public` are denoted by the `public:` and `private:` attributes and anything declared below them have either public or private access respectively.
